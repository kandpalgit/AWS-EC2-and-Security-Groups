1 Aws - It looks like you're interested in AWS Cloud! AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive and widely used cloud computing platform offered by Amazon. It provides a variety of services like computing power, storage options, databases, machine learning, analytics, networking, and much more. amazon web services provide 190+ services in the cloud.

Ec 2 :

Each EC2 instance must be associated with at least one security group (you can associate multiple security groups if necessary).

You can modify the security groups after instance creation, so you donâ€™t need to re-launch instances to apply new firewall settings.

2 Azure: - Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and service created by Microsoft. It offers a variety of cloud services, including those for computing, analytics, storage, and networking. Azure enables businesses to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centres

Gcp services

GCP frequently introduces new services, APIs, or features in preview. Examples include:

AI and Machine Learning: New tools for developing machine learning models, AI APIs, and advanced analytics features.

Cloud Storage: New options for storing data with additional capabilities like enhanced performance, new storage classes, or additional data management options.

Networking: New networking features or optimizations, such as new load-balancing solutions or improvements in private network management.

Big Data: Tools for working with large datasets, often released as previews, to allow developers and data scientists to test the features before they become stable.

Summary of Key Differences Between AWS, Azure, and GCP Security Groups:
AWS: Security groups are stateful, applied to instances, and can be combined for more granular control.

Azure: Uses Network Security Groups (NSGs), which can be applied to subnets or individual NICs, and can include both inbound and outbound rules.

GCP: Uses Firewall Rules in VPCs to control traffic, supporting global and regional configurations with network tags for flexibility.
